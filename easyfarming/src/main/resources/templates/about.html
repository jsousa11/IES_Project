                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <h3>What can you do here?</h3>
                    <p>On this page you can upload images of plants and find out everything about them: their description, caracteristics and if it is harmless for your pets.
                        If you want to keep all this information without having to upload a photo every time you want to take care of a plant, you can log in and had the plants you want, and you can even receive notifications about watering your plants depending on the weather.</p>
                    <h3>Why was this page created?</h3>
                    <p>This page was created in the scope of the project for the Introduction to Software Engineering subject, where each group had to propose, conceptualize and implement a multi-tier, enterprise-class application.
                        This specific theme was chosen because we thought it would be very interesting both to implement and to use and it would be something that can help people.</p>
                    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                    <p>We are three students from the <a href="https://www.ua.pt/">University of Aveiro</a>, in the Computer Engineering course: Catarina Marques, João Sousa and Vânia Morais</p>
